/**
    Description about font inclusion in TcHmi

    As a default we include Roboto Condensed (in Fonts folder) as a webfont which will render latin, greek, vietnamese, cyrillic glyphs

    If Roboto does not render the glyphs we use some preinstalled fallback
    'Microsoft YaHei' (Windows), 'Hiragino Sans GB' (Mac/iOS), 'Noto Sans CJK SC/TC' (Android), 'WenQuanYi Micro Hei' (Linux) renders chinese
    'Meiryo' (Windows), 'Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro' (Mac/iOS), 'Noto Sans CJK JP' (Android) renders japanese

    For other fonts you can add the woff files into the tchmi project and
    add a @font-face section yourself
    The noto family from google tries to cover all of the world, is free to use and fits nicely with roboto
    see https://www.google.com/get/noto/ and https://fonts.google.com/earlyaccess

    The font usage is defined in the main css file of the active theme (for example Themes/Base/Style.css).
